	   <h1>A Network Analyst's View of the Block Chain</h1>

	   <p><strong><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/network-analysts-view-block-chain">This
		 article was published at CoinDesk</a>.</strong></p>

	   <p>The block chain is a decentralized, consensus-driven ledger
	     of every successful bitcoin transaction to date. As of the
	     300,000th block, the ledger includes over 38 million
	     transactions.</p>

	   <p>Aside from being a monumental technical achievement, the
	     block chain is a fascinating dataset. We can use it to create a
	     transaction network that models the flow of bitcoins from the
	     creation of the genesis block to the present day.</p>

	   <p>In this network, every node represents a transaction and
	     every (directed) edge represents a flow of bitcoins from an
	     output of one transaction to an input of another. This large,
	     complex network has over 38 million nodes and 85 million
	     edges.</p>

	   <h2>Network Science</h2>

	   <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science">Network
	       science</a> is the study of complex networks. It provides
	     theories, techniques and tools that help us understand the
	     structure and evolution of a network. The bitcoin transaction
	     network is a prime example. Its basic building block, the
	     transaction, can be combined to produce complex transfers of
	     value. This is reflected in the topological structure of the
	     transaction network.</p>

	   <p>The network as a whole is too large and complex for most
	     network visualization tools. However, we can measure various
	     structural properties of the network. For example, transactions
	     can be characterized by their varying numbers of inputs and
	     outputs. But how are these numbers distributed in practice? In
	     the transaction network, we can analyze the in- and out-degrees
	     of the nodes. We can plot the in- and out-degree
	     distributions. They show, for each possible degree, the number
	     of times they occur in the network.</p>

	   <div style="text-align: center;">
	     <a href="/assets/network-analyst/transaction-network-in-degree-distribution.png">
	       <img src="../img/network-analyst/transaction-network-in-degree-distribution.png"
		    title="The in-degree distribution of the transaction network.">
	     </a>
	   </div>

	   <div style="text-align: center;">
	     <a href="/assets/network-analyst/transaction-network-out-degree-distribution.png">
	       <img src="../img/network-analyst/transaction-network-out-degree-distribution.png"
		    title="The out-degree distribution of the transaction network.">
	     </a>
	   </div>

	   <p>In both cases, we observe inverse relationships between these
	     numbers. The lower the degree, the more frequently nodes with
	     that degree occur; the higher the degree, the less frequently
	     they occur. There are many outliers. The outlier in the
	     out-degree distribution with out-degree equal to two is due to
	     an abundance of transactions with exactly two outputs.</p>

	   <h2>Giant Connected Component</h2>

	   <p>Suppose we were able to visualize the entire bitcoin
	     transaction network. It would probably resemble a
	     &quot;hairball&quot;. These visualizations suffer from
	     cluttering and over-plotting to an extreme that makes them
	     unusable for any practical purposes. However, they do provide
	     one key piece of information. Are we dealing with one large
	     connected component or several smaller connected components?</p>

	   <div style="text-align: center;">
	     <a href="/assets/network-analyst/hairball.png">
	       <img src="../img/network-analyst/hairball.png"
		    title="Many visualizations of large networks are hairballs.">
	     </a>
	   </div>

	   <p>A connected component is a group of nodes and edges that are
	     all connected to each other, either directly or indirectly. If a
	     network has a giant connected component, this means that almost
	     every node is reachable from almost every other node. If we
	     ignore the direction of the edges in the bitcoin transaction
	     network, then it does indeed contain a giant connected component
	     covering over 99.9% of all nodes. The second largest connected
	     component has just 71 nodes.</p>

	   <h2>Fourteen Degrees of Separation</h2>

	   <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">Six
	       degrees of separation</a> is the theory that everyone on the
	     planet is connected to everyone else through a chain of
	     acquaintances with no more than six hops. In network science
	     terminology, this translates to the theory that the social
	     network of the human race has diameter
	     six. Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-team/anatomy-of-facebook/10150388519243859">reported</a>
	     that the effective diameter (covering 90% of all pairs of users)
	     of its social network is five and is decreasing with time.</p>

	   <p>The equivalent number for the bitcoin transaction network is
	     fourteen and is increasing with time. That is, across 90% of all
	     pairs of transactions, the shortest path between them in the
	     transaction network (ignoring directionality) is at most
	     fourteen hops. The increasing value is likely due to the fact
	     that, unlike the Facebook social network, there is
	     no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment">preferential
	       attachment</a>. New nodes are connected to existing nodes whose
	     corresponding transactions are not yet fully redeemed. In other
	     words, the transaction network is growing at the frontier
	     only.</p>

	   <h2>The First Currency with a Ledger</h2>

	   <p>Surprisingly, Bitcoin is not the first currency with a ledger
	     from which we can model the transfer of value. The Tomamae-cho
	     community currency was introduced into the Hokkaido Prefecture
	     in Japan for a three-month period during 2004-05 in a bid to
	     revitalize the local economy. The Tomamae-cho system involved
	     gift-certificates that were re-usable and legally redeemable
	     into yen. There was an entry space on the reverse of each
	     certificate for recipients to record transaction dates, their
	     names and addresses, and the purposes of use, up to a maximum of
	     five recipients.</p>

	   <p>Researchers collected these certificates in order to derive a
	     network structure that represented the flow of currency during
	     the period. They showed, for example, that the network
	     had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small
	       world properties</a>.</p>

	   <p>The block chain is a digital equivalent to the Tomamae-cho
	     certificates. It does not contain information such as names and
	     addresses or the purposes of use. However, it has other
	     properties that make it suitable for analyzing the transfer of
	     value including its accuracy, size, and completeness.</p>

	   <p>The application of network analysis to the block chain is an
	     under-explored, yet fascinating area. There are a handful of
	     academic studies but very little in the way of software and
	     tools to open it up to a wider
	     audience. <a href="http://www.quantabytes.com">QuantaBytes</a>
	     is developing a suite of tools for analyzing and visualizing
	     Bitcoin&#39;s block chain. By understanding the structure and
	     evolution of the block chain, we can better understand
	     Bitcoin&#39;s usage patterns, economy, and the growth of the
	     system as a whole.</p>
